## Task 1: Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection
**Objective:** Build a tool to identify anomalies in stock price trends to detect unusual activities or
market manipulations.
**● Dataset:** Yahoo Finance Stock Market Dataset
**● Steps:**
1. Download and preprocess historical stock price data for a few chosen
companies.
2. Calculate financial indicators (e.g., SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands).
3. Use Isolation Forest or DBSCAN for unsupervised anomaly detection.
4. Build a time-series forecasting model using LSTM or Prophet to identify
deviations.
5. Visualize detected anomalies on stock price trends.
**● Outcome:** A tool or report identifying anomalies in stock price trends and possible
market manipulations.


## Task 2: Multi-Label Emotion Recognition from Text
**Objective:** Develop a system to classify multiple emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) present in
textual data.
**● Dataset:** GoEmotions Dataset by Google
**● Steps:**
1. Preprocess the dataset, handling imbalanced data.
2. Fine-tune a transformer model such as BERT for multi-label classification.
3. Evaluate the model using metrics like Hamming loss and F1 score.
4. Test the system on real-world textual data such as customer feedback or social
media posts.

**● Outcome:** A system capable of analyzing emotional tones with multiple labels.

## Task 3: Satellite Image Analysis for Deforestation Monitoring
**Objective:** Use satellite imagery to detect and monitor deforestation areas over time.
**● Dataset:** Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space
**● Steps:**
1. Preprocess multi-band satellite images for land cover analysis.
2. Train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for land classification.
3. Perform change detection using sequential images to identify deforestation
areas.
4. Visualize environmental changes over time.
**● Outcome:** A system that detects and monitors deforestation.

## Task 4: Credit Risk Analysis
**Objective:** Build a model to assess the creditworthiness of customers and flag high-risk
customers for financial institutions.
**● Dataset:** Give Me Some Credit Dataset
**● Steps:**
1. Preprocess the dataset, handling missing data and imbalances using techniques
like SMOTE.
2. Engineer features related to income, debt, and repayment history.
3. Train models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost.
4. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
**● Outcome:** A system that reduces default rates by flagging high-risk customers.

## Submission Requirements
For each task:
**1. Python Code:** Well-documented and commented scripts for the implemented models.
**2. Report:**
○ Dataset preprocessing steps.
○ Model selection and rationale.
○ Challenges faced and solutions.
○ Results with visualizations and interpretations.
**3. Video Demonstration:** A 5-7 minute video for each task, showcasing the
implementation and results.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- **Hardware:** Google Colab or a local system with GPU support.
